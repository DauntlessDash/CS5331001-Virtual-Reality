# The Penthouse (CS 4331)

For this project I created a web-based VR Penthouse that you can walk through via a simple github URL on your computer or smartphone. This was created for a Texas Tech University class on Virtual Reality. You can play the live demo at https://dauntlessdash.github.io/VRRoom-CS4331/.

## VR Penthouse Features

The following screenshots highlight some of the different elements in the VR Penthouse.

The main feature of the Penthouse that stands out is that you see central park outside of two of the windows. This is achieved by having a flat plane with the image of central park suspended a distance outside the window. Also in this area is two red leather sofas, a modern glass coffee table, and in the background you can see a shelf in the kitchen.

This kitchen area features the second window, a table with four chairs, a refrigerator, counter tops, and an oven.

This area has some of the barstools in it as well as the lighting controls. The lighting can be changed inside the penthouse by clicking on the different corresponding light-level buttons.

Through a door is the main bed with a nightstand and lamp.

Outside of the door is my dog, Beau. He is permanently spinning and might get dizzy.

Here there is two more L-shaped couches, a glass coffee table, and the main TV of the house.
