# The Penthouse (CS 4331)

See example here: https://github.com/manorepo/Text-Visualization
Create a 1-minute video showing the use of your application with your voice over. That video should appear on the top of your github readme file. The video can be used as a backup during your presentation just in case of something go wrong.
Add a link to your web-based application (right after the video). You can host it on your github or your ttu personal page.
Clearly explain the duties of each student in your group (if you work as a group).
Describe your application by screenshots (with meaningful captions) and text. Make sure you have the list and screenshots of models.
Links to all the source code and any assets (models, textures, sounds). Make sure you source code is well-commented.

For this project I created a web-based VR Penthouse that you can walk through via a simple github URL on your computer or smartphone. This was created for a Texas Tech University class on Virtual Reality.

## VR Penthouse Features

The following screenshots highlight some of the different elements in the VR Penthouse.

The main feature of the Penthouse that stands out is that you see central park outside of two of the windows. This is achieved by having a flat plane with the image of central park suspended a distance outside the window. Also in this area is two red leather sofas and a modern glass coffee table.

This kitchen area features the second window, a table with four chairs, a refrigerator, counter tops, and an oven.

This area has some of the barstools in it as well as the lighting controls. The lighting can be changed inside the penthouse by clicking on the different corresponding light-level buttons.

Through a door is the main bed with a nightstand and lamp.

Outside of the door is my dog, Beau. He is permanently spinning and might get dizzy.

Here there is two more L-shaped couches and the main TV of the house.
